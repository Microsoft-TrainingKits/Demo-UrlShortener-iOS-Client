## Overview ##

This demonstration shows how to connect a iOS client to a backend service running in Windows Azure Websites.  

Widows Azure Websites enables developers to quickly get up and running with websites.  Websites may be developed in ASP.NET, Node.js and PHP.  In addition, websites may use SQL or MySQL for data storage.  Deployment can be accomplished in several ways including TFS, FTP, and GIT.

### Reviewing the App's Functionality ###

1.  In XCode, go to the top right and ensure an iPhone simulator (e.g. iPhone 5.1 Simulator) is selected.

	![Selecting the Simulator](Images/xcodeBuildSettings.png?raw=true "Selecting the Simulator")

	_Selecting the Simulator_

1.  Go to the Product menu and select Build.

1.  Ensure the top build status shows a success.

	![Build Success](Images/buildSucceeded.png?raw=true "Build Success")

	_Build Success_

1.  Go to the Product menu and select Run.

1.  The iPhone Simulator should start and after a moment, you should see the URL(s) you generated via the URL in the previous demo.

	![URL List](Images/urlList.png?raw=true "URL List")

	_URL List_

1.  Tap a shortened URL.

	![Tapping a Shortened URL](Images/tappingShortenedUrl.png?raw=true "Tapping Shortened URL")

	_Tapping Shortened URL_

1.  You should now be viewing the details for a URL.

### Reviewing the App's Code Base ###

> **Speaking Point**
>
> Now that we've seen the functionality of the application.  Let's look through some of the code that accomplishes the communications with the web service.

1.  Return to XCode.

1.  Return to the Project Navigator by clicking the button in the top left.

	![Returning to the Project Navigator](Images/returnToProjectNavigator.png?raw=true "Returning to the Project Navigator")

	_Returning to the Project Navigator_

1.  Open ViewController.m in the project navigator.

1.  Point out the following code in the ViewController class.

````C#
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    //Hit the server for URL data
    dispatch_queue_t backgroundQueue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
    dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^{
        NSData* data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL: 
                        [NSURL URLWithString: kGetAllUrl]];
        [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(fetchedData:) 
                               withObject:data waitUntilDone:YES];
    });
}
````
> **Speaking Point**
>
>Here we're creating a background queue and dispatching it to run asynchronously in the background.  We're telling it to fetch the contents of the URL "kGetAllUrl" which was defined in the Constants.m file.  Finally, we're telling it to call the **fetchedData** method when it's complete.

1.  Continue down in the file and show the **fetchedData** method.

````C#
- (void)fetchedData:(NSData *)responseData {
    //parse out the json data
    NSError* error;
    NSDictionary* json = [NSJSONSerialization 
              JSONObjectWithData:responseData
              
              options:kNilOptions 
              error:&error];
    
    NSString* status =[json objectForKey:@"Status"];
    NSLog(@"status: %@", status);
    _success = [status isEqualToString:@"SUCCESS"];
    
    //If we successfuly pulled the URLs, show them
    if (_success) {
        NSDictionary* urls = [json objectForKey:@"Urls"];
        NSLog(@"urls: %@", urls);
        AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
        appDelegate.urls = [urls mutableCopy];
        
        [self.tableView reloadData];
    } else {
        //Otherwise, show an error
        UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Error" 
                    message:@"There was an error loading the URL data.  Please try again later." 
                   delegate:self 
          cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
          otherButtonTitles:nil];
        [alert show];
    }
}    
````

> **Speaking Point**
>
>Here, we're attempting to deserialize the data that came back back into a NSDictionary.  We then check the Status flag to see if polling the server was a success.  If it was, we put the URLs that came from the server into an NSDictionary and set that dictionary to a property on the AppDelegate.  We then tell the Table View to reload (it uses the object on the AppDelegate as it's datasource).  

1.  Scroll down in the class and look at the didAddUrlWith slug method.

````C#
- (void)urlDetailsViewController:(UrlDetailsViewController *)controller didAddUrlWithSlug:
                                (NSString *)urlSlug andFullUrl:(NSString *)fullUrl {
    
    // Create the request.
    NSMutableURLRequest *theRequest=[NSMutableURLRequest 
                                     requestWithURL:
                                     [NSURL URLWithString: kAddUrl]
                                     cachePolicy:NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy
                                     timeoutInterval:60.0];
    [theRequest setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];
    [theRequest addValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"];    
    //build an info object and convert to json
    NSDictionary* jsonDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                    @"my_key", @"key",
                                    fullUrl, @"url",
                                    urlSlug, @"url_slug",
                                    nil];
    //convert JSON object to data
    NSError *error;
    NSData* jsonData = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:jsonDictionary 
                                            options:NSJSONWritingPrettyPrinted error:&error];    
    [theRequest setHTTPBody:jsonData];        
    //prints out JSON
    NSString *jsonText =  [[NSString alloc] initWithData:jsonData                                        
                                                encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    NSLog(@"JSON: %@", jsonText);
    
    // create the connection with the request and start loading the data
    NSURLConnection *theConnection=[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest delegate:self];
    if (theConnection) {
        // Create the NSMutableData to hold the received data.
        // receivedData is an instance variable declared elsewhere.
        receivedData = [NSMutableData data];
    } else {
        // We should inform the user that the connection failed.
    }
    
    AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
    
    //Add shortened URL locally
    [appDelegate.urls setObject:fullUrl forKey:urlSlug];
    NSIndexPath *indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:appDelegate.urls.count -1 inSection:0];
    [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:
                    [NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] 
                    withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
    [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
    [self.navigationController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    [self.tableView reloadData];    
}
````

> **Speaking Point**
>
>This is a delagate method that is called from the URL Details screen when the user adds a new URL.  
>
>In it, we generate a NSMutableURLRequest which we piont at kAddURL (from Constants.m).  We then bulid a NSDictionary which is filled with the details of the Shortened URL.  This dictionary is serialized to JSON and then passed via the NSURLConnection to the server.  
>Lastly, the new shortened URL is added to the appDelegate's dictionary of shortened URLs and the TableView is told to reload.
>The rest of the code is app functionality and doens't directly relate to communications with the server.

## Summary ##

In this demo, you saw how easy it is to communicate with a service layer running in Windows Azure Websites.  You took a prebuilt iOS application and pointed it at a web service that you previously deployed and demonstrated how it works.
